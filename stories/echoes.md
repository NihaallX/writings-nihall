**Torrential**

*by Nihall*

It was raining heavily

8:02 PM, the walls of my house silent but listening.

Over a year since we shifted here,
yet the monsoon still taps like it's checking in on me.

Mom, cooking in the kitchen,
hands me a plate of kanda bhajis.

She nods toward the downpour,
says, “Look at the rain. It’s torrential.”

Vocabulary check ,yep, she meant it.

For a breath,
I’m not here.

I’m back in that old room.

Nothing fancy just a flicker.

Then snap. I’m home again.

Still, my eyes drift
to the top-left corner of the roof

as if water might crawl through sealed layers

just to remind me where I came from.

I walk to Mom,

half-laughing, half-hollow:

“It’s like I’m still 16 or 17,

scared the rain will come in sideways

leak into my setup:

one chair, two tables, a laptop,

its chargers, and some things

I don’t need but refuse to move

because they belong nowhere else.”

Back then,

I'd wait for the rain to pause,

then clean the flood like a ritual

quietly begging the clouds

not to return this way too soon.

Or ever.

Well…

I’m 20 now.

The roof is fixed.

But my heart still has a leakage of memories and moments I quite can’t get rid of...
