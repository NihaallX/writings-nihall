She was a late admission, and no one had noticed her. But one day, as our class teacher called out attendance, my eyes scanned the room and met hers. It was a strange, yet delightful feeling - like nothing I had ever experienced before.

In the weeks that followed, we didn't have many opportunities to interact. We would catch glimpses of each other, but that was about it.

One rainy day, after our classes ended, my two friends and I gathered at the campus entrance, waiting for the rain to subside. And there she was, the girl my friend had a crush on. We playfully teased him, and in that moment, our eyes locked once again. It felt right.

I tried not to be the one to initiate eye contact, but it seemed like she couldn't help but look at me (or maybe I'm just imagining things). Then, out of nowhere, she disappeared. We searched for her on the first floor, but she was nowhere to be found. Disappointed, we returned to the ground floor, only to find her engaged in a conversation with a guy from our class who was clearly flirting with her. It was amusing, but I could see the boredom in her eyes as she tried to end the conversation and catch my gaze. We had the eye contact we anticipated, but after that, we simply continued on our separate ways through the rain. It was a bittersweet moment.

I admire everything about her - her appearance, her sense of style, her beautiful physique, and her self-assurance. I love it when she blushes and smiles. I long to hear her voice.

During lunch one day, we all found ourselves gathered at the same campus entrance, making our way to the cafeteria. While waiting with my friend, I suddenly turned and saw her standing there with her friend. I smiled at her and graciously stepped aside to let her pass through the space between me and my friend. It was a charming moment, and even after it had passed, I couldn't wipe the smile off my face. Every time I think about it, I still find myself smiling.

It's only as I write down these words that I realize how deeply I care for this girl and the meaningful encounters we've had. It brings me immense joy to express these feelings.
