Today, my mom mentioned the woman across the street —

how she feeds her dog by hand,

just like my mom fed me when I was little... and even now.

It was soft, warm — a memory wrapped in a smile.

Without thinking, I replied,

*“As if Meera Nani didn’t feed the dog that wasn’t even hers.”*

And the moment the words left my mouth,

they felt wrong. Heavy.

Like they didn’t belong to me.

My tongue stumbled over *“Meera Nani”* —

not because she wasn’t kind,

but because she isn’t here anymore.

And that dog — it’s been adopted by someone else now.

That little world is gone.

What I said wasn’t cruel.

But it wasn’t careful either.

There’s a silence that follows some names.

Today, I learned to listen for it.
