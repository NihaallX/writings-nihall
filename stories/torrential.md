It was the first day of college, and we were in the introduction- phase.

As soon as I saw her, I couldn't take my eyes off her. 

My friend said she was okayish, but I thought she was gorgeous.

I clearly remember the exact moment our eyes met and we had a spark. 

I hoped we both knew it meant something.

Over the next two weeks, our eyes met multiple times, but we still didn't talk to each other. 

I vividly remember the day we finally had a conversation. She gave me her book to copy some questions, and our eyes met, and our hands touched. 

I returned the book only to realize that something cute awaited me. 

She teased our mutual friend, addressing me, and we shared a laugh. 

She was sitting in the parallel row, and she rested her hand on my table. I glared at her, and she had a smirk. 

She fumbled and said, "I forgot what I was going to say," and was embarrassed. She didn't even look at me for a while. 

But when I was drinking water, I saw her staring at me from the corner of my eye, and I still didn't look at her.
