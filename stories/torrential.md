**Torrential**

*by Nihall*

It was raining heavily

8:02 PM, the walls of my house silent but listening.

Over a year since we shifted here,
yet the monsoon still taps like it's checking in on me.

Mom, cooking in the kitchen,
hands me a plate of kanda bhajis.

She nods toward the downpour,
says, “Look at the rain. It’s torrential.”

Vocabulary check ,yep, she meant it.

For a breath,
I’m not here.

I’m back in that old room.

Nothing fancy just a flicker.

Then snap. I’m home again.

Still, my eyes drift
