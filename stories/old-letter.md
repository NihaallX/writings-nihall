I wanted you
but did I fight for you?

You showed interest;
I did too
but as a man,
they expected more of me.
And I didn’t deliver.

I feared I'd come on too strong,
so I stayed cool,
nonchalant.
I shouldn't have.

Maybe you don’t even feel the same now.
That’s okay.
Maybe that’s what I deserve.

Still, thank you
for not being a rebound,
for helping me move on.
I never wanted you to be just that.

I wanted more
us.

And I should’ve fought for it.
I could’ve.
