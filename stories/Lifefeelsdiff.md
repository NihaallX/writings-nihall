when its june, 

and you're no longer 16,

haven't been it for a long time

 but you still feel young and 

Same

life feels Different

when you ask for help, 

and the only hand that reaches

is your own,

cant believe childhool is over.

life feels Different

when you take quiet photos

of your old room

 in the shutter of memory, 

trying to frame

how it made you feel

LIFE FEELS DIFFERENT
