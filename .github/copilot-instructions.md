This project is a cozy, animated, story-focused portfolio site for a creative writer, built with Next.js (App Router), TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion. Prioritize smooth, immersive UI, markdown-based story content, and a dreamy, distraction-free aesthetic. Include a Secret Writer Mode Easter egg as described in the project brief.
